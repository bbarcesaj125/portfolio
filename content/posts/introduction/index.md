Greetings! This is the first post on this blog. 
First, let me introduce myself. I am Youssef Felliaui and I am a programmer/web developer living in France.
I am very passionate about programming, and I always try to learn something new. I mainly work with JavaScript (NodeJs, ReactJS, GraphQL), but I also can write code in other languages as well such as Python, Java, and a bit of C#. I am a Linux and Open Source enthusiast and have been using Linux as my main OS for 10 years at least. I currently maintain two blogs:

- [Tootips](https://www.tootips.com) which is a tech blog centered around Linux and the Open Source culture in general
- [Creativewire](https://www.creativewire.one) which contains articles about science and technology

I created this website as a way to showcase my skills as a well as an outlet to express my thoughts and experiences about programming. I will try to keep this blog updated with new articles as I go about my programming journey.
